I needed some example files to test some download processes, so I decided to make the files and the script I used available.

This project does not need any dependencies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Edit the `src/index.js` file to generate the files you want, inform the values in **MB**, currently, files of **5**, **10**, **50** and **100MB** are generated.
3. `yarn start` or `npm run start`
4. Wait for the process to finish and check the `out` folder
